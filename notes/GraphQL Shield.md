# Graphql Shield

GraphQL Shield is a library used for implementing authorization and permission rules in GraphQL APIs. It provides a flexible and declarative way to define and enforce access control rules for various GraphQL operations, such as queries and mutations.

With GraphQL Shield, you can define rules that specify which users or roles can access certain fields, queries, or mutations based on different conditions. These conditions can include factors like the authenticated user's role, ownership of resources, or any custom logic you define.

The library integrates with popular GraphQL server frameworks, such as Apollo Server and Express, making it easy to incorporate into your existing GraphQL application. It works by intercepting and validating incoming GraphQL requests before they are resolved, allowing you to block or allow access based on your defined rules.

GraphQL Shield supports a variety of authentication and authorization mechanisms, including role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and custom logic. It also provides utilities for composing rules, handling errors, and accessing contextual information about the incoming request, such as the authenticated user.

By using GraphQL Shield, you can add an additional layer of security to your GraphQL API and ensure that only authorized users can access specific data or perform certain operations. It helps you enforce fine-grained access control and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of your data.
